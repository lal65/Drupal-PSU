Drupal.psu.edu highlights the use of the open-source Drupal CMS at Penn State, and serves as the online home of the Penn State Drupal Users Group (DUG), an association of developers, designers, and users who currently leverage the power of Drupal across Penn State.

Drupal.psu.edu is the home for all Drupal happenings at the university and this group is a good way to connect with other Drupal users about their projects. Join us and get involved in your local Drupal community!
